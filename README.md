### Rationale
- Research on this platform as well as best practices \ guidelines can help contribute to novel materials in `gray literature` and perhaps its tie-ins to `open-source` work pertaining to accessible and possibly scalable web development concepts. 
- The research may or may not contain code.


### Accessibility
- We aim to follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards to ensure usability, accessibility, and compliance.


### Security
- The nature of the research being made public on a Git-based version-control platform can perhaps support data integrity and / or security.
- Role-based access control (RBAC)-related: Repository settings are currently set to Public but can be changed to Private.

### Contribution Guidelines
